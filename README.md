# CS576_FinalProject
This is the actual repository for the final project

## NOTE
## MAKE SURE TO ONLY STORE THE ASSETS, PROJECT SETTINGS, PACKAGES, AND THE FINAL_PROJECT SOLLUTION FILE

### LIBRARIES TO BE INSTALLED
## WINDOW -> PACKAGE MANAGER -> UNITY REGISTRY
Packages you need:
- 3D World Building
- 3D Character and Animation
- High Definition RP
- At this point I hit generate lighting a couple times: WINDOW -> RENDERING -> LIGHTING -> GENERATE LIGHTING
- Visual Scripting
