I was responsible for setting up the outdoor portion of the map, containing the obstacle course and the transition 
to the maze portion. Additionally, I set up the lighting system for the indoor portion of the maze, as well as helping Noah 
set up, fix, and debug the minimap. To allow for the movement for the Blake character, I created character controllers, Animator
controllers, as well as a third person camera that rotates to allow for movement. Overall, I also set up general lighting and 
rendering pipelines, leading the switch from URP to HDRP, as well as initiative for gathering prefabs, models, textures, skyboxes, 
etc.
